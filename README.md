## Introduction

The notebook includes various exploratory data analyses (EDA) to examine relationships among factors such as Income Category, Number of Transactions, Average Utilization Ratio, Educational Level, etc. The data is then processed for ingestion into PyTorch to build a binary classification model. Details of the neural network and its implementation are documented in the notebook.

## Dependencies

Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
